Medically Underserved Populations in California
====

#### Map created by Lydia Nowak. 

*Project Outline*

This lab for Web Mapping was focused on the creation of an interactive choropleth and point data map. This data is meant to serve as a helpful aid in better displaying information related to a news article about being in need of medical centers and resources. There are many rural areas of California where medical resources, facilities, and professsionals are lacking. This map is purposed to help map these areas to find out where upcoming doctors and nurses would be most needed to reach populations where are medically underserved. The data source describing medically underserved populations gives each section of California a score associated with their need, a 62.0 and higher signifying the most need. Thus, finding the areas with these higher percentages as well as places without hospitals, would find the best fit for incoming medical professionals.

*Sources and Process* 

I used data from California State Geoportal to download data for the health facilities in the state. The medically underserved areas were collected from the Health Resources and Services Administration. The news article was from the San Bernadino County Medical Society. This article was written for the California Medical Association to spread awareness for how people in more rural areas can recieve more medical professionals. There is concern for people in rural areas not having the appropriate amount of access to resources and medical help, so this map would be a good addition to the article.
